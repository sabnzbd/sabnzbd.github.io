<p>SABnzbd is fully IPv6 enabled: it can download from IPv6 enabled news servers, and you can access SABnzbd's web-interface over IPv6.</p>

<p>Based on HappyEyeballs, SABnzbd will choose the quickest connection to a newsserver: via IPv4 or via IPv6</p>
<h3>Access SABnzbd's web-interface over IPv6</h3>
<p>To access SABnzbd's web-interface over IPv6, you need to fill out <code>::</code> in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/general">General</a> at the field "SABnzbd Host". Press Save Changes, and then restart SABnzbd.<br>
    As a first test, you should be able to access SABnzbd via <code>http://[::1]:8080/</code>. If that works you can fill out the public IPv6 address of your system running SABnzbd, so something like <code>http://[2001:dead:beef::b055]:8080/</code>
</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> By default both IPv6-enabled routers and Windows' IPv6 interface behave like IPv4-NAT-devices: drop unknown incoming connections. So, to make SABnzbd accessible over IPv6 from the outside world, you have to configure your modem and Windows to accept connections.</p>
