<p>SABnzbd is fully IPv6 enabled: it can download from IPv6 enabled news servers, and you can access SABnzbd's web-interface over IPv6.</p>

<h3>Download from IPv6 enabled news servers</h3>

<p>
    SABnzbd will automatically use IPv6 if available when connecting to news servers.
    Based on HappyEyeballs, SABnzbd will choose the quickest connection to a newsserver: via IPv4 or via IPv6

<h3>Access SABnzbd's web-interface over IPv6</h3>

    As a first test, you should be able to access SABnzbd via <code>http://[::1]:8080/</code>. 
    If that works you can fill out the public IPv6 address of your system running SABnzbd, 
    so something like <code>http://[2001:dead:beef:cafe:123:4567:b055]:8080/</code>
