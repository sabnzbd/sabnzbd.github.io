title: Servers
---
<p>If you want to download anything, you need to have access to one or more Usenet servers.
    These servers can be your own ISP's Usenet server, a free public one or one of the many commercial servers.
    For each server you need to specify its parameters.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc1">Priorities</h2>
<p>You assign each server a priority, a number between <code>0</code> (highest) and <code>99</code> (lowest).<br>
    SABnzbd will first try to get articles from the group of servers with the highest priority.
    Within the priority group, the first server with a free connection will be tried.
    When the first tried server doesn't have an article, then another server with the same priority is tried.<br>
    When none of the primary servers has a specific article, a lower priority group is tried. Within the lower priority group, the same method is used: the first server with a free slot is tried.
</p>

<h2>Article availability</h2>
<p>This statistic will show you how many of the requested articles were available on this server. The number of requested articles is included, to offer a comparison between the servers. It could be that some higher priority servers are tried less often. If they are tried less often but still have a low article availability, it might not be worth having this subscription.

If the alternative server has a shorter retention time, you will miss articles if the articles are beyond the retention time of the alternative server.
