            <td>
                <p>This is a folder that is periodically checked for new NZB files. When a file is stored in this folder, SABnzbd will consider this a download job. It will scan the folder and processes the supported files: <code>.nzb, .gz, or .bz2</code> and archives <code>.zip, .rar, or .7z,</code>. The process will add the NZB to the queue and remove the file from the watched folder if successful. ZIP/RAR/7z archives should only contain .nzb files inside (.nfo are silently ignored).</p>
                <p>The Watched Folder supports <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/categories">Categories</a> in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Create a folder inside your watched folder with the same name as one of your categories. Placing a file inside that folder will add the category with the same name as the sub-folder when it is imported. <br>
                    Example: If you have a category called <code>Random</code>, place a file inside <code>C:\WatchedFolder\Random</code> and it will be picked up and assigned to the <code>Random</code> category (if it exists). </li>
                    <li><strong>Filename Prefix:</strong> If an NZB file has a prefix, for example {% raw %}<code>{{movies}}My favorite movie.nzb</code>{% endraw %}, it will be handled as the file <code>My favorite movie.nzb</code>, having category <code>movies</code>.</li>
                </ul>

                Number of seconds between filesystem scans of the Watched Folder setting above.
                Setting it to <code>0</code> disables the automatic scans, but scans can still be triggered from the menu on the main page.<br>

            <td>This specifies the folder where user scripts (post-processing and pre-queue) are stored. On Windows, users may specify a .cmd or .bat file; other extensions can be executed with the <code>PATHEXT</code> variable. On Unix any installed script type can be used, including common choices such as shell or Python, provided the file is executable (<code>chmod +x file</code>) and starts with a valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang line</a>. <br>Read more about creating <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/scripts/post-processing-scripts">Post-processing</a> and <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/scripts/pre-queue-scripts">Pre-queue</a> scripts.</td>
