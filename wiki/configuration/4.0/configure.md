SABnzbd comes with sensible defaults to work, however, there are plenty of options and tweaks to tailor SABnzbd to your needs.
View the relevant page for more information on what an option does and more.

All configuration data is stored in the so-called `sabnzbd.ini` file. Which `sabnzbd.ini` file used, you can see on the Configuration main page.
Default locations for each operating system can be found in [Folder Setup](/wiki/advanced/directory-setup).

SABnzbd relies on using existing utilities to extract, repair, and process files once they have been downloaded.
Some of these utilities are provided with SABnzbd while some require the user to install, also some may only be optional depending on how you use SABnzbd.
