When free space on the drive that holds the temporary folder is below this, SABnzbd is automatically pauses and an (optional) email is sent to the user. You enter the amount in bytes but you can use factors like K, M, G etc. Note: SABnzbd will not automatically resume downloading. You have to make diskspace available AND resume SABnzbd manually.</td>

                <p>This is a folder that is periodically checked for new NZB files. When a file is stored in this folder, SABnzbd will consider this a download job. It processes the file, puts it in the queue and removes the NZB file. ZIP and RAR files that contain <em>only</em> NZB files will be processed too<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>
                <p>The Watched Folder supports <a href="/wiki/configuration/2.0/categories">Categories</a> in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Create a folder inside your watched folder with the same name as one of your categories. Placing a file inside that folder will add the category with the same name as the sub-folder when it is imported. <br>
                    Example: If you have a category called <code>Random</code>, place a file inside <code>C:\WatchedFolder\Random</code> and it will be picked up and assigned to the <code>Random</code> category (if it exists). </li>
                    <li><strong>Filename Prefix:</strong> If an NZB file has a prefix, for example {% raw %}<code>{{movies}}My favorite movie.nzb</code>{% endraw %}, it will be handled as the file <code>My favorite movie.nzb</code>, having category <code>movies</code>.</li>
                </ul>

On Windows, users may specify a .cmd or .bat file; other extensions can be executed with the <code>PATHEXT</code> variable.
