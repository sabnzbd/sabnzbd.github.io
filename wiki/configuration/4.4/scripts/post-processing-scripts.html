title: Post-processing scripts
---

<p>
    SABnzbd can run a user-provided post-processing scripts. The scripts can be associated with a job entry when adding the job manually, via <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/categories">category</a> or during downloading. Scripts can also be run as an end-of-queue event.
    A post-processing script will only run when the job has completed without errors.
    If you want to always run the script, you need to disable the option <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/switches">Post-Process Only Verified Jobs</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Scripts may use any scripting language available on your system; common choices are Python, Unix shell, and Windows batch scripts.
    All scripts must be located in the Scripts-directory, specified in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/folders">Config-&gt;Folders</a> and must be executable.
    On Unix-like operating systems (Linux, BSD, etc.) this means the x-bit must be on.
    On Windows, the requirement is that the script's extension is listed in your system's <code>PATHEXT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p>
    The console output of the script is captured by SABnzbd and is saved in the so called "Script Log" which can be opened from the history details.
    The output will be added to the (optional) notification email and can be examined in the History page.
</p>

<p>
    The "return" code that your script itself returns should be <code>0</code> if all went well or non-zero if errors occurred. If the return code is something else than <code>0</code>, SABnzbd's History will show that return code (also known as exit code) as <code>Exit(...)</code> in the History. By default the job will not be flagged as failed in case the exit code is non-zero. In <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/switches">Config-&gt;Switches</a> there is the option to let a non-zero code mark the job as failed.
</p>

<p>
    Example scripts are included in the <code>scripts</code> directory of your SABnzbd installation and are shown at the end of this page.

<h2>Basic parameters</h2>

<p>The script will receive the parameters described below. Use <code>%1</code> in Windows scripts and <code>$1</code> in Unix scripts. Note that on Windows the input parameters are surrounded by quotes (e.g. <code>"job name"</code>).</p>
