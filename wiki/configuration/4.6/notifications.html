<h2>Email notifications</h2>
<p>SABnzbd can send you emails about completion of jobs and about disk almost full condition.
    You can send email through the SMTP server of your ISP. This is generally the easiest option, that doesn't require you to set a user account and password.
    SABnzbd will try to use SSL secured email when supported by the mail server (this normally requires a user account and password).
    Even Google mail (gmail.com) is possible.
</p>
<p>It's possible to create your own email format by using <a href="/wiki/extra/email-templates">templates</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that Gmail security has become a lot stricter.<br>
    If you are using two-factor authentication then you need to create an "application-specific" password for SABnzbd.<br>
    See: <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1173270?hl=en">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1173270?hl=en</a>
</p>
<p>If not, then SABnzbd is only allowed to access Gmail when you allow "less secure apps".<br>
    See: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps">https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps</a>
</p>
<p>For security reasons we recommend that you create a separate email account, just to send SABnzbd emails.</p>

<h2 id="toc3">Notification Services</h2>
<p>SABnzbd can send notifications to several notification services.
    All events that can produce a notification are assigned to a group.
    Such groups can be enabled per notification services.<br>
    Additionally, you can specify for the job related notifications if they only should be send for specific categories.
