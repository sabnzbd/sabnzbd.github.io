<p>
    SABnzbd can read RSS-feeds provided by indexers or public RSS websites.
    These sites offer the latest downloads or return results based on a query. For a list of supported RSS sites, <a href="/wiki/introduction/nzb-sources">see here.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Each feed is analyzed using filters.
    A filter looks for a text-pattern in the title of entries and will reject or accept a job based on that pattern.
    A filter "matches" a title if the filter text is found inside that title.
    You can add <code>*</code> to match arbitrary parts of the title or <code>?</code> for one arbitrary character at that place.
    The filters are analyzed in order and the first one matched will be selected.

<h2>An example</h2>
<p>
    Suppose you subscribe to a feed and the output of titles in this feed is:
</p>
<div class="code">
<pre><code>My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 1
You and me and the dog Part 2
My first teen steps hdtv xvid Part 1
My first baby steps xvid Part 1
My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 2
The making of My first baby steps xvid hdtv</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, suppose you want to get all <code>My ... first steps</code> episodes, but only when marked <code>hdtv</code> and you're not interested in <code>Making of</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Reject || making of
Accept || first*steps*hdtv</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>Reject</code> filter should be placed first, otherwise the <code>Accept</code> filter will also pick the <code>Making of</code>.</p>
<p>
    It's also possible to setup a <code>Required</code> filter.
    This means that the following filters are only applied when a title matches the <code>Required</code> filter.<br>
</p>
<p>
    For example: if you are only interested in <code>hdtv</code> format, you would create filters like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>Reject || making of
Requires || hdtv
Accept || first*steps
Accept || second*steps</code>
</pre>
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>
    For each feed you can set the category or the <a href="/wiki/extra/job-options">job options</a> for all jobs in the feed in the top row, or for each <code>Accept</code> filter specifically.<br>
    If all category settings are left as <code>Default</code> and the indexer category matches one of your categories (by category name or by <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/categories">custom <code>Indexer tag</code></a>), it will be automatically assigned to that category. <br>
</p>
<p>
    The assigned or automatically matched category is shown in the Category column.

<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>
    If you prefix a filter with <code>re:</code> it will be interpreted as a Python regular expression (case-insensitive).
</p>
<p>
    Here's a <a href="http://www.developer.com/lang/article.php/3330231" target="_blank">tutorial on regular expressions</a>.
    For all the details see <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html" target="_blank">the Python manual</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Simple example: <code>re: this|that</code> will match all jobs containing <code>this</code> or <code>that</code> in the title.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Automatic processing</h2>
<p>
    If you check the checkbox next to the name of the feed, it will be automatically processed. The time between scans can be set with <code>RSS checking rate</code>. This can be overridden by using the Scheduler.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>First batch</h2>
<p>
    To prevent the download of a (potentially) large backlog, the first batch of NZBs will <b>not</b> automatically download. These lines are marked with an asterisk <code>*</code>. If you want these matched feed items in this first batch to download, click the <code>Force Download</code> button.
</p>
<p>
    Then, new feed items in subsequent RSS reads will download automatically (if the feed is enabled).
