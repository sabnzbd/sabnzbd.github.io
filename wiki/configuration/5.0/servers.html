title: Servers
---
<p>If you want to download anything, you need to have access to one or more Usenet servers. For each server you need to specify its parameters.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc1">Priorities</h2>
<p>You assign each server a priority, a number between <code>0</code> (highest) and <code>99</code> (lowest).<br>
    SABnzbd will first try to get articles from the group of servers with the highest priority.
    Within the priority group, the first server with a free connection will be tried.
    When the first tried server doesn't have an article, then another server with the same priority is tried.<br>
    When none of the primary servers has a specific article, a lower priority group is tried. Within the lower priority group, the same method is used: the first server with a free slot is tried.
</p>

<h2>Article availability</h2>
<p>
    This statistic will show you how many of the requested articles were available on this server. The number of requested articles is included, to offer a comparison between the servers.
    It could be that some higher priority servers are tried less often. If they are tried less often but still have a low article availability, it might not be worth having this subscription.

                Usenet providers offer different amounts of simultaneous connections.
                You may need to specify the maximum amount allowed in order to get full speed. Do not use a large number.
                Most servers work best with anything between <code>8</code> and <code>30</code>.<br>

                Set here the maximum retention time of your server. Retention means the number of days that articles are kept by the server. <code>0</code> means infinite retention. <br>
                Only use this when you have multiple servers and you want to avoid that SABnzbd wastes time on asking servers for articles it cannot have.
                Be aware that retention times advertised by Usenet providers are not absolute. If you set it too low, your others servers will be used more intensely.
                There is no reason to set a retention time when you have only one server.

            <td>
                <p>If you use multiple servers and some of these servers are not very reliable, you can declare them "optional". This means that if such a server causes too much problems (like time-outs) it will be ignored for some time.</p>
                <p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> When you declare a server with a long retention time as optional and the server is temporary out-of-service, SABnzbd will fall back to another server.
                    If the alternative server has a shorter retention time, you will miss articles if the articles are beyond the retention time of the alternative server.
                    It is best to set your most reliable and longest retention time server as a lower priority server but not as optional.
                    Secondary servers (cheaper, less reliable, shorter retention time) can be set as <em>high priority</em> and <em>optional</em>.
