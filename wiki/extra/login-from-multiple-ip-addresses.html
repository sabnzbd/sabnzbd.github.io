<p>If you get the warning <code>Login from multiple different IP addresses</code>, it means your news server provider sees your account logging in from different IP addresses.
News server provider often don't allow this, because it looks like you're sharing your account with someone else. However, the cause is often different: you're not sharing your account, but your logins come from different IP addresses.

<h2>There can be different causes for this:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>You're switching between VPN and no-VPN, or fixed and mobile internet connection.</li>
    <li>Your account is used from a different location at the same time, by you or maybe someone else (= account sharing).</li>
    <li>SABnzbd is switching between IPv4 and IPv6.</li>
    <li>Your ISP is using a technology "CGNAT" (Carrier Grade NAT), in which you share one IP address with other ISP customers, and that IP address can change for different sessions.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Things worth trying:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Don't do the first two things above.</li>
    <li>If your behind CGNAT, hopefully your ISP also provides you IPv6. You can check the IPv6 address in SABnzbd in the Status and Interface settings (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> window. If so, use the IPv6 address of your news server</li>
</ul>
