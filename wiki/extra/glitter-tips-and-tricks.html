<h2>Speed tips</h2>
<p>Unrelated to Glitter, we have some tips and tricks in case SABnzbd is not hitting the limits of your connection: <a href="/wiki/advanced/highspeed-downloading">Highspeed Downloading</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Edit multiple jobs</h2>
<p>When you want to quickly set options for multiple jobs, click on <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks"></span>.
    <br>You can first select what options you want changed and then select to which jobs these changes should be applied, or first select the jobs and then the changes you want. Changes are applied instantly.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> The jobs you select will be remembered, so if you go to another page of jobs and then change an option, it will also be applied to the jobs you selected before.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Searching the Queue</h2>
<p>Only when there's more items than the Queue item limit (set in Status and Interface settings, <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface) or when editing multiple jobs, the search box for the queue appears.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Select ranges of items (jobs, files)</h2>
<p>When editing multiple jobs or when viewing the files within a job ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> ), you can select a range of items by first clicking the first of the items you want selecting, then hold <code>SHIFT</code> when you select the last item in the range.</p>
<p>It's also possible to use the Check All button to select all items or un-select all in case some were already selected.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Extra Queue and History columns</h2>
<p>Glitter offers the option to display extra information in the Queue and History by selecting them in Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface). This way you can always see for example a job's Category, Script, etc. or similar information in the History.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Tabbed layout</h2>
<p>When you prefer to have the Queue and History not on the same page but in tabs (much like the old Classic interface), you can activate this in Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface).</p>

<hr>
<h2>Pick date/time formats</h2>
<p>In Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface) you can choose to display the time Twitter/Facebook-style instead of the regular date/time format. You can also change it to a different notation.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Disable confirmations when deleting items from Queue/History</h2>
<p>In Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface) you can choose to not be asked if you are sure when deleting a job or history item. There is no way to restore jobs or history items after deleting.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Add (multiple) NZB's by drag-and-drop</h2>
<p>You can drag and drop NZB's directly onto the Glitter interface in your browser. It's not limited to 1 NZB, you can drag multiple NZB's at once or add archives containing multiple NZB's directly.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Delete from history based on search term</h2>
<p>The History-delete button also allows to delete all the items on the current page, this way when you search for something you can remove all items matching your search term at once.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Quickly set password for a job</h2>
<p>You can set a password for a job quickly by adding at the end of a job name the password after a <code>/</code>, this will parse it as a password. So set it to <code>JOBNAME / PASSWORD123</code> and it will set the password for the job to <code>PASSWORD123</code>.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Custom pause</h2>
<p>You are not limited to the pre-defined settings of pausing, in the same menu next to the pause button you can choose Custom. Here you can enter a pause duration in minutes, hours, days or even set a specific end time. When you say <code>tomorrow 17:00</code>, it will calculate how many minutes that is. Other examples are <code>90 minutes</code>, <code>2 days</code>, <code>Friday 2am</code> or <code>10 September, 17:00</code>.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Quickly clear speedlimit</h2>
<p>When you set a speedlimit, the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> icon will appear in the speed display. By clicking <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> the speedlimit will be removed.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Set action when all downloading is complete</h2>
<p>In the menu ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-hamburger"></span> ) you can set what needs to happen when all downloading (and post-processing) is complete. For example Shutdown PC, Standby PC or run a script. This option was always available, but somewhat hidden.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    // Check the main language to show a message
    var isNotEnglish = false
    if (navigator.language.indexOf('en') === -1) {
        isNotEnglish = true
    } else {
        // Check other languages
        if (navigator.languages) {
            $.map(navigator.languages, function(lang) {
                if (lang.indexOf('en') === -1) {
                    isNotEnglish = true
                }
            })
        }
    }
    // Only now show
    if (isNotEnglish) {
        $('.alert-translate').show()
    }
</script>
