<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>Several people have created utilities that work with SABnzbd to simplify and automate much of your usenet experience: <a href="/wiki/extensions-for-sabnzbd">Extensions for SABnzbd</a></p>

<h2>Speed tips</h2>
<p>We have some tips and tricks in case SABnzbd is not hitting the limits of your connection: <a href="/wiki/advanced/highspeed-downloading">Highspeed Downloading</a></p>

<hr>
<h2>Edit multiple jobs</h2>
<p>To quickly set options for multiple jobs, click <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks"></span>.</p>
<p>First select the options to change, then select to which jobs these changes should be applied. Or, first select the jobs and then the changes. Changes are applied instantly.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> Changes are applied to <b>all</b> selected jobs, whether they are on the current page or not.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Searching the Queue</h2>
<p>The queue search box appears only when there are more items than the Queue item limit (set in Status and Interface settings, <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface) or when editing multiple jobs.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Select ranges of items (jobs, files)</h2>
<p>When editing multiple jobs or when viewing the files within a job ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> ), select a range of items by clicking the first of the items, then press and hold the <code>SHIFT</code> key and select the last item in the range.</p>
<p>It's also possible to use the Check All button to select all items or un-select all in case some were already selected.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Extra Queue and History columns</h2>
<p>Glitter offers the option to display extra information in the Queue and History by selecting them in Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface). This way you can always see for example a job's Category, Script, etc. or similar information in the History.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Tabbed layout</h2>
<p>If you prefer to have the Queue and History not on the same page but in tabs (much like the old Classic interface), you can activate this in Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface).</p>

<hr>
<h2>Pick date/time formats</h2>
<p>In Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface) you can choose to display the time Twitter/Facebook-style instead of the regular date/time format. The notation can also be changed.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Disable confirmations when deleting items from Queue/History</h2>
<p>In Status and Interface settings ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span>, Web Interface) you can choose to not be asked if you are sure when deleting a job or history item. There is no way to restore jobs or history items after deleting.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Add (multiple) NZB's by drag-and-drop</h2>
<p>You can drag and drop NZB's directly onto the Glitter interface in your browser. It's not limited to a single NZB: you can drag multiple NZB's at once or add archives containing multiple NZB's directly.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Delete from history based on search term</h2>
<p>The History-delete button also allows to delete all the items on the current page, this way when you search for something you can remove all items matching your search term at once.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Quickly set password for a job</h2>
<p>Set a password for a job by adding to the end of the job name. Edit the name and add <code>/</code> then the password. SABnzbd will parse it as a password. So set it to <code>JOBNAME / PASSWORD123</code> and it will set the password for the job to <code>PASSWORD123</code>.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Custom pause</h2>
<p>You are not limited to the pre-defined settings of pausing, in the same menu next to the pause button you can choose Custom. Here you can enter a pause duration in minutes, hours, days or even set a specific end time. When you say <code>tomorrow 17:00</code>, it will calculate how many minutes that is. Other examples are <code>90 minutes</code>, <code>2 days</code>, <code>Friday 2am</code> or <code>10 September, 17:00</code>.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Quickly clear speedlimit</h2>
<p>When you set a speedlimit, the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> icon will appear in the speed display. By clicking <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>, the speedlimit will be removed.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Set action when all downloading is complete</h2>
<p>In the menu ( <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-hamburger"></span> ), set what needs to occur when all downloading (and post-processing) is complete. For example: <code>Shutdown PC</code>, <code>Standby PC</code> or run a script.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    // Check the main language to show a message
    var isNotEnglish = false
    if (navigator.language.indexOf('en') === -1) {
        isNotEnglish = true
    } else {
        // Check other languages
        if (navigator.languages) {
            $.map(navigator.languages, function(lang) {
                if (lang.indexOf('en') === -1) {
                    isNotEnglish = true
                }
            })
        }
    }
    // Only now show
    if (isNotEnglish) {
        $('.alert-translate').show()
    }
</script>
