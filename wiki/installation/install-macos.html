title: Install SABnzbd for macOS
---

<h2>The official App</h2>
<p>If you just want to use SABnzbd, we provide a packaged application (64bit-only) available  <a href="/downloads">here</a>. <br/>Pick the right folder for your macOS version and drag SABnzbd to the Applications folder.</p>

<h2>How to run from sources on macOS</h2>
<p>If for some reason you don't want to use the app, you can install from source.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install <code>pip</code>, if it's not already installed, by running:<br>
    <pre><code>sudo -H easy_install pip</code></pre> (or without <code>sudo</code>, if you have the right permissions)
    </li>
    <li>Install the depenencies by running:<br>
    <pre><code>sudo -H pip install cheetah3
sudo -H pip install cryptography
sudo -H pip install sabyenc</code></pre>

    It could be that SABYenc does not get recognized, try the following commands (requires Xcode):
<pre><code>sudo -H pip uninstall sabyenc -y
sudo -H pip install git+git://github.com/sabnzbd/sabyenc</code></pre></li>
    <li>Finally, download the <a href="/downloads">source code</a>, unpack into any folder (e.g. ~/SABnzbd).<br>
    Don't compile or anything, just run from source:
    <pre><code>cd SABnzbd/
./SABnzbd.py</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Your default web browser should now start and show the user interface of SABnzbd.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">Running from Terminal</h2>
<p>Since the "-d" option of SABnzbd+ is not working under Leopard, we need to create a daemon environment. This can easily be done by running the command in <em>screen</em>. This also adds running at a low priority so that it willl affect system performance less. The final command looks like this (provided that SABnzbd+ is still on your desktop):</p>
{% highlight sh %}
cd SABnzbd/
/usr/bin/screen -m -d /usr/bin/nice -n 20 ~/SABnzbd/SABnzbd.py -b 0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>screen -m -d: starts the command in a detached screen.</li>
    <li>nice -n 20: starts the command with the lowest processor priority.</li>
    <li>SABnzbd.py -b 0: starts the SABnzbd+ without autostarting your browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start SABnzbd+ at boottime<br>
    Run this script in crontab periodically, so that SABnzb+ is started at boottime and will be kept running.
</p>
{% highlight sh %}
#!/bin/bash
active=$(/bin/ps aux | grep -v grep | grep SABnzbd.py)
if [ "$active" = "" ]
then
    /usr/bin/screen -m -d /usr/bin/nice -n 20 ~/SABnzbd/SABnzbd.py -b 0
fi
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Should you ever need to run the compiled app from Terminal, this is the way:</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>/Applications/SABnzbd.app/Contents/MacOS/SABnzbd</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you need to see the logging output directly tro the console:</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre><code>/Applications/SABnzbd.app/Contents/MacOS/SABnzbd --console</code></pre>
</div>
