title: Known issues

<p>These are known issues regarding the working of SABnzbd in its environment.<br>
    They are not registered as bugs of SABnzbd, because we cannot solve them.<br>
    It's more an incompatibility with other systems or outright bugs in these other systems.

<h2 id="toc0">Size limit</h2>
<p>To prevent unexpectedly large NZBs from eating your quotum you can set the option "size_limit" in <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/special">"Config-&gt;Special"</a>.<br>
    Any NZB larger than this size will be set to paused and get a low priority.
</p>

<h2 id="toc1">Hangup of post-processing</h2>
<p>When PAR2 or UNRAR hang up, you should never just stop SABnzbd.<br>
    Instead use your operating system's task manager to stop the Par2 or UNRAR program.<br>
    Forcing SABnzbd to quit may damage your queues.<br>
</p>

<h2 id="toc5">Unreliable Usenet servers</h2>
<p>Some Usenet servers have intermittent login (or other) problems.<br>
    For these, the server blocking method is not very favorable.<br>
    There is an <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/special">"Special" option</a> "no_penalties" which, when set to 1, will limit blocks to 1 minute<br>
    (No, 2 doesn't mean 2 minutes).
</p>

<h2 id="toc6">macOS and foreign characters</h2>
<p>On macOS you may encounter downloaded files with foreign characters (e.g. é and ä).<br>
    The par2 repair may fail when the files were created on a Windows system.<br>
    The problem is caused by the PAR2 utility and we cannot fix this now.<br>
    This does not apply to files inside RAR files.
</p>

<h2 id="toc7">Linux and foreign characters</h2>
<p>On Linux when you download files they may have the wrong character encoding.<br>
    You will see this only when downloaded files contain accented characters.<br>
    You need to fix it yourself by running the <strong>convmv</strong> utility (available for most Linux platforms).
</p>

<h2 id="toc8">Files remain in Watched Folder</h2>
<p>The "Watched Folder" sometimes fails to delete the NZB files it has processed.<br>
    This happens when other software still accesses these files.<br>
    Some third-party utilities supporting SABnzbd are known to do this.<br>
    We cannot solve this problem, because the Operating System (read Windows) prevents the removal.<br>
    SABnzbd does try about 10 times with 5 second intervals, but after that it gives up.<br>
    The NZB will not be processed again, unless changed or overwritten.
</p>

<h2 id="toc12">Blocked email</h2>
<p>When SABnzbd cannot send notification emails, check your virus scanner, firewall or security suite.<br>
    It may be blocking outgoing email.
</p>

<h2 id="toc13">Mounting external drives and network shares</h2>
<p>When you are using external drives or network shares on macOS or Linux make sure that the drives are mounted.<br>
    The operating system will simply redirect your files to alternative locations.<br>
    You may have trouble finding the files when mounting the drive later.
