title: Downloads cannot be completed

<p>If you get one of these messages, it means there are not enough "blocks" that can be downloaded to recreate the complete post.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Aborted, cannot be completed</code></li>
    <li><code>Download failed - Not on your server(s)</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>There can be different causes for this:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>The most likely cause: the post is not available (anymore) on the newsserver you use because the post has been (partly) removed because of DMCA notices. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act" target="_blank">More info on DMCA</a>.</li>
    <li>The post is not yet available on the newsserver you use. This can happen in the first few minutes or hours after posting. Wait an hour longer or use the <a href="/wiki/configuration/{{ site.wiki_version }}/switches#toc2">Propagation Delay</a> feature.</li>
    <li>The post is not available anymore on the newsserver you use because the post is older than the newsserver retention. For example: retention is 1000 days, and the post is 1200 days old.</li>
    <li>The post itself has too little repair block (<code>par2</code> files).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Things worth trying:</h2>
<p>First of all: you could be out of luck. If you want to still want to try things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use another or an additional newsserver.</li>
    <li>Find another post with the same contents.</li>
    <li>Check on a Usenet search engine to see if the post was completely available.</li>
</ul>
