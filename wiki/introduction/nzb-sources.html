title: NZB Sources
---
<p>SABnzbd does not browse Usenet headers. Instead, it accepts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZB" target="_blank">NZB files</a> to process</sup>.
    An NZB file contains a full specification of all Usenet articles that are needed for a download. You can get these files from sites such as those listed below.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> Usenet servers hold all kinds of material, sometimes of questionable origin and legality.
    Please be careful and confirm that downloading this material is legal in your country. This is <strong>your</strong> responsibility, not the authors of SABnzbd, nor the sites offering NZB files.
</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning">NOTE</span> SABnzbd does not endorse or require the use of any specific indexer.
    They all work with SABnzbd perfectly fine so long as they generate NZBs - none of these sites require specific "SABnzbd integration".
    Before paying for an indexer, please keep in mind there are no guarantees and any site could disappear at any time without notice.<br>

<h2>Raw search engines</h2>
<p>These are classic search engines that index and give you results by keywords. No human influence, which means little-to-no logic filtering out bad posts (spam/virus/password protected/etc) or un-obfuscating encrypted posts. Just an algorithm to search.</p>
<p><span class="label label-danger">WARNING</span> Be careful when obtaining NZBs through this method - user discretion is advised.</p>
<p><strong>The lists below are randomly sorted on every page-load to give each website equal exposure.</strong></p>
