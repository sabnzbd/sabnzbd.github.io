<h2>Usenet basics</h2>
<p>If you're a beginner with Usenet, you should first find a website explaining the concepts (for example, this <a href="http://www.binaries4all.com/beginners/" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="http://www.binaries4all.nl" target="_blank">Dutch</a> website explains everything in great detail).
    You should especially find out about how to obtain NZB files that define your downloads. On this Wiki you can find all the information you'll need to setup SABnzbd and customize it. If you experience trouble, please post on our <a href="http://forums.sabnzbd.org/" target="_blank">Forum</a>.

<h1 id="toc4">Installing SABnzbd</h1>
<h2 id="toc5">Windows</h2>
<p>Run the installer, follow the prompts. When prompted for installation options, decide if you want SABnzbd to launch in the background when you log in, if you want it to be associated with <code>.nzb</code> files, and if you want a desktop icon created.</p>
<h2 id="toc6">macOS</h2>
<p>Double-click the <code>.dmg</code>, drag the <code>.app</code> to Applications. You're done!</p>
<h2 id="toc7">Ubuntu Linux</h2>
<p>You already installed it via apt. After installing, edit <code>/etc/default/sabnzbdplus</code> if you want SABnzbd to run at startup.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="toc8">Upgrading SABnzbd</h1>
<p>For all operating systems, to upgrade SABnzbd simply shut down SABnzbd and re-install. In it's a major release (e.g. from 0.7.20 to 1.1.0), it's always better to finish the queue first before updating.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="toc9">The Wizard</h1>
<p>After launching SABnzbd for the first time, you'll be presented with our quick-start wizard which will hopefully get you up and running as soon as possible. All settings can be changed later in the various Configuration pages. Here's a quick walk-through:</p>

<h2 id="toc13">Server Setup</h2>
<p>Enter the server information provided by your news host. If you're using SSL, be sure to tick the SSL checkbox. Once you've entered your server details, click the "Test Server" button to determine if the connection works.</p>

<h2 id="toc15">Restart</h2>
<p>You've reached the end of the wizard! Once you've reached this page, SABnzbd will automatically restart. Please wait for it to finish. After a few seconds you'll be presented with a link to <code>http://localhost:8080/sabnzbd</code>. You should bookmark this link, as it's how you'll access SABnzbd in the future.</p>
