<p>If you get "login from multiple ip addresses", it means your newsprovider sees your account logging in from different IP addresses.
Newsproviders often don't allow this, because it looks like you're sharing your account with someone else. However, the cause is often different.

<h2>There can be different causes for this:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>You're switching between VPN and no-VPN, or fixed and mobile Internet connection</li>
    <li>Your account is used from a different location too, by you or maybe someone else (= account sharing)</li>
    <li>SAB is switching between IPv4 and IPv6</li>
    <li>Your ISP is using CGNAT</li>

</ol>

<h2>Things worth trying:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Don't do the first two things above.</li>
    <li>If your behind CGNAT, hopefully your ISP also provides you IPv6. You can check that in SABnzbd -> Wrench symbol -> IPv6. If so, use the IPv6 version of your newsprovider's newsserver</li>
</ul>
